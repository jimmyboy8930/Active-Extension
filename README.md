## Features Overview

### 1. New Tab
This is a basic web page extension that includes a clock and several links displayed as buttons. You can customize this as you need, making it a simple and efficient tool for daily use.

### 2. Schedule
This section is the most advanced part of the app, functioning similarly to filling out forms. It includes a button to set the current date, making data entry faster. 

- **Modify Old Data:** Old data can only be changed after clicking the "Modify" button.
- **Save as CSV:** Once you are done, you save your schedule as a CSV file.
- **Import CSV:** You can import the CSV file to continue working from where you left off.

This structure enhances security by avoiding data storage within the browser, and instead relying on external CSV files. However, I donâ€™t personally use this feature because I prefer not to log everything I do.

### 3. Unicode
This feature is also quite advanced. While there are many websites that offer superscripts and subscripts, I created an alternative by combining these with Greek letters (before I developed an interest in Greek). Additionally, there is other useful Unicode here, which I used to rely on for taking notes.

### 4. Photos
You can experiment with this feature by replacing the provided photos with ones of your choice. I used to rely on this feature daily before I memorized my university schedules and times.
